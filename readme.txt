== Description ==

Here at Spotlight Studios we love UIKit. This plug-in is designed to be a fast way to implement the framework into your website; whatever you website is based on.

A Fast Lightweight Framework
UIKit is a lightweight and modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.

Settings Page
All of the features are compartmentalized so that you only need to load what you’re going to use. Enable the main UIKit plugin, then go on to load JavaScript and Add-ons that you need.

Add-ons
Installing an Add-on such as the date-picker onto an existing UIKit based theme? Just enable that feature! The existing css style will be left (enable the add-on style if required).

Choose your Style
You can choose between the Basic, Gradient or Mostly-Flat styles using the drop-down menu.

== Installation ==

Once the plugin is activated, choose the UIKit functions you wish to activate in Settings | SS UIKit
